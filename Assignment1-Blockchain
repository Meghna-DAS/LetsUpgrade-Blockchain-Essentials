Block chain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A block chain is a 
constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place in a secure, chronological and immutable way in a 
decentralised distributed network.
2.	What is the core problem block chain trying to solve?
Block chain is trying to solve the problem of International banking crisis that came with the collapse of the investment in 2008. 
Block chain provides security and authenticity over these problem.
3.	What are the few features block chain will give you?
•	Immutability
•	Decentralized Technology
•	Enhanced Security
•	Distributed Ledgers
•	Consensus.
•	Faster Settlement.
4.	What all things does a block chain contain?
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, Mining key and Block Number.
5.	How the verifiability of the block chain has been attained?
 Each and every person involved in the group will check the hash provided. If the hash of all the participants is the same, 
 then the data is similar to one another. But if the hash of one of the participants is different, then we can cross-check what was the 
 difference of the data which was leading to a different hash
